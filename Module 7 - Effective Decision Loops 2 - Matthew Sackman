1. Prompt user for input: `Enter years left until retirement: `
2. Prompt user for input: `Enter the annual amount you can save: `
3. Initialize variables:
    - `annual_savings = user input`
    - `retirement_years = user input`
    - `total_savings = 0`
    - `interest_rate = 0.03`
    - `annual_expense = 60000`
    - `year = 1`

4. While `year <= 30` AND `total_savings > 0`:
    a. Accumulate `total_savings` with interest: `total_savings = total_savings + (annual_savings * interest_rate)`
    b. Deduct `annual_expense` from `total_savings`
    c. Display `Savings at start of year: total_savings`
    d. If `total_savings <= 0`, print `Savings depleted`
    e. Increment `year`

5. End program
